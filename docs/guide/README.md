## Development guide

Before gettings started, it's important to read through the [Vue.js style guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/), as this repo will follow the recommendations from it.

To start development, check out the repo on Github: [dataforsyningen/SDFE_UI_Components](https://github.com/dataforsyningen/SDFE_UI_Components), and follow the guide in the README.

### Naming
